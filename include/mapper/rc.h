 * the reference counting is not automatic. However, the library itself handles the majority
 * of this; in general, the lifetime of any mpr_obj constructed by the library is at least
 * as long as the lifetime of the graph associated with it. */

 * to memory allocated with `malloc` or its ilk. The rc API will free the data after the
