 * \defgroup dlist Data Lists
 * @{
 * The `mpr_dlist` API provides a generic list cell for making simple linked lists.
 * A reference counting mechanism ([mpr_rc](#mpr_rc.h)) is used to ensure that the lifetime of dlist
 * managed memory exceeds that of all references to it, including references made by other
 * dlist cells in a linked chain.
 * 
 * The counting mechanism tracks data shared between cells,
 * and forward links within lists of cells; backwards links are not counted so as to avoid
 * creating reference cycles. Because of this, if the user does not keep a reference to the
 * front of the list, e.g. while iterating over a list, then the list will be progressively
 * freed as the iterator advances through the list.
 * 
 * A null pointer is always considered a valid list, i.e. a null list.
 * Note however that many methods require a pointer to a list; this pointer should not be null,
 * although the dereferenced value may be.
 * 
 * A mpr_dlist is represented by a pointer to a mpr_rc, i.e. a `void**`. The user can treat this
 * as a pointer to a pointer to whatever, and dereference it to access the data in the list cell.
 * Example: To access a mpr_dataset held in a list of datasets, the user may write
 * `mpr_dataset data = *(mpr_dataset*)dlist;`
