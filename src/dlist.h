/* The `mpr_dlist` API provides a generic list cell */

/* List cells can be requested to allocate data, in which case they take ownership of the data, or
 * they can be passed another list cell. When a `mpr_dlist` is copied or passed as data to a new
 * cell, rather than copying its data, a reference to it is used. In this special case, a reference
 * counting mechanism is used to ensure that the lifetime of the resource exceeds that of all
 * references to it. The counting mechanism tracks cells that directly refer to other cells,
 * and forward links within lists of cells; backwards links are not counted so as to avoid
 * creating reference cycles. Because of this, if the user does not keep a reference to the
 * front of the list, e.g. while iterating over a list, then the list will be progressively
 * freed as the iterator advances through the list. */

/* The user should never assign to or from a `mpr_dlist`, as doing so would circumvent the
 * reference counting mechanism. All functions that would require the user to receive a
 * value from the API should use a return variable in the form of a pointer to a `mpr_dlist`,
 * usually called `dst`. Defined behavior should be given for all values of `dst`
 * including a null pointer, a pointer to a null pointer, or a pointer to an existing list.
 * Obviously, undefined behavior will result if a pointer to something else is given. */

 * takes responsibility for this resource and will free it at the appropriate time by calling
